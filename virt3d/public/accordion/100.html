   Optaflexx in beef was recently approved by the FDA. This growth promotant increases muscle mass and feed efficiency with minimal changes in tenderness or taste of beef.
	Calf-fed and yearling production systems are being compared. Cattle placed in a feedlot immediately after weaning and harvested around 14 months of age are more tender than cattle raised within a yearling production system.
